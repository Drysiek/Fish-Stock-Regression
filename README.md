# Fish-Stock-Regression
MSID project

Simply run main file and wait for the program to print values of mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error for linear model, SVR model and custom model regression. Soon after, program will show figure with real and predicted values of fish used in fish stock.


After transporting random rows of data from 'Fish Stocking.csv' to 'random_fish_stocking_rows.csv', program takes data to pandas dataframe.
Next program creates linear regression model, RVS model and custom regresion model and creates figure using matplotlib library.
Finally program calculates mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error for these regression models and shows figure with real and calculated values.
